**Backlog Note 1:** Backlog items are written as user stories, but you must click on each item to see the story.
**Backlog Note 2:** The numbers preceding the item titles are story points.

**Rationale for Backlog Ordering:**  

**Definition of Ready:**  

A product backlog item is ready when:

- it has a meaningful title;
- it is expressed as a user story;
- it is defined clearly;
- it is not subject to further clear subdivision;
- it is estimated in story points; and
- it is not dependent on any other backlog item being completed first.

(In addition to course activities, this definition of ready also was influenced by articles by Scrum Inc., at https://www.scruminc.com/2014/07/20/definition-of-ready/; and Mike Cohn, Mountain Goat Software, at https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-dangers-of-a-definition-of-ready.)

**Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity:** The Bucket System (see http://www.agileadvice.com/2013/07/30/referenceinformation/agile-estimation-with-the-bucket-system/).
Only development team members participated in estimating backlog item sizes.
